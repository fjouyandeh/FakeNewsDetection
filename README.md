Since  the  start  of  the  spread  of  the  Coronavirus  disease(COVID-19)  worldwide,  there  have  been  speculations  about the time it would take to develop a vaccine. Now that vaccinesare  being  rolled-out,  news  about  this  topic  is  spreading  ata  high  level,  and  it  is  on  the  trend.  Although  governments,health  officials  and  credible  news  agencies  are  working  to spread accurate information regarding the vaccination process,fabricated  stories  and  misleading  information  have  also  been spreading  through  different  media  outlets.  This  could  play a  notable  role  in  people’s  judgments  regarding  the  vaccine and  have  a  negative  impact  on  a  society’s  future  in  fighting COVID-19. In  this  project we  proposed  a  model  that  detects  fake  tweets related to the COVID-19 vaccine.
