# FakeNewsDetection

Social  media  has  become  profoundly  important  inhow  billions  of  people  consume  news  and  events,  bypassingjournalists (the conventional gatekeepers of breaking news) in theprocess. Events in the real world result in an explosion of Twittermessages   (tweets).   This   highlights   the   value   of   informationcontained  on  social  media  sites  such  as  Twitter.  This  paperdocuments  the  process  to  build  a  model  detecting  fake  news.We have used various data classification methods like K-NearestNeighbors,  Logistic  Regression,  Random  Forest,  Adaboost  andSupport  Vector  Machines  on  the  data  to  differentiate  tweetsbetween real and fake news. For our machine learning models, weused  tweet  features  as  our  predictors.  We  achieved  an  accuracyof  98.68%  from  both  Adaboost  classifier  and  Random  Forestclassifier.  As  a  result,  we  applied  Adaboost  as  one  of  the  bestclassifiers  to  our  unlabeled  dataset  to  predict  its  labels.
