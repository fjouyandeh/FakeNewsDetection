# FakeNewsDetection

Social media has become profoundly important in how billions of people consume news and events, bypassing journalists (the conventional gatekeepers of breaking news) in the process. Events in the real world result in an explosion of Twitter messages (tweets). This highlights the value of information contained on social media sites such as Twitter.
This paper documents the process to build a model detecting fake news. We have used various data classification methods like K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Adaboost and Support Vector Machines on the data
to differentiate tweets between real and fake news. For our machine learning models, we used tweet features as
our predictors. We achieved an accuracy of 98.68% from both Adaboost classifier and Random Forest classifier. As a result, we applied Adaboost as one of the best classifiers to our unlabeled dataset to predict its labels.
